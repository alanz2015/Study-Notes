This article describe a 4-DOF robotic arm design w/ 1 x DC motor and 4 x Digital Servo motor, and PID algo is design via Matlab.

Basic Concept
-------------
Torque, Dead Band Width, 2-channel H-bridge Driver Module, Bi-Phase Encoder

It is important to have motors with the correct torque specifications for each one of the joints, there are free online apps to 
calculate torque for robotic arm joints [4]. You need to provide inputs, such as the configuration of the robotic arm 
(how many degrees of freedom it has), link lengths, link weights, loads and so on.
We can begin the experimental robotic arm design based on the off-the-shelf aluminum robotic arm kit [3] to ease the mechanical 
implementation and concentrate all efforts on the electronics and code parts of the system.
