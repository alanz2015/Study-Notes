How to support TFTPBOOT via yocto build result
--------------------------------------------------------
Background
    Several projects involve enabling pxeboot in non-disk work station env, so here I summary on the guidance.
    
Steps
1. Install tftpd & nfs servers and configure respetively
    sudo apt-get install -y nfs-kernel-server xinetd tftpd tftp
    Configure /etc/exports to add $HOME/nfsrootfs that can support NFS rootfs mount
    Configure /etc/xinetd.d/tftp to set "server=/usr/sbin/in.tftpd  server_args=/tftpboot" that referenced by tftp server
    
2. Contents stored in /tftpboot/

Maybe grub file bootx64.efi do not have network module.  You can try to use grub provided by Ubuntu http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/uefi/grub2-amd64/current/grubnetx64.efi.signed

Or  build your own grub that build-in with network capability.

In your root tftp server create a grub folder with grub.cfg.
/tftpboot/grub/grub.cfg

Your grub.cfg should look like this
=============================
Set timeout 5

menuentry "core-image-sato" {
    linux image/bzImage
    initrd image/initrd
}

==============================

Put your image in tftp root
/tftpboot/image/bzImage
/tftpboot/image/initrd

If you want to put your rootfs in NFS. You need to include network module in kernel and  extract your rootfs for example to /srv/rootfs.  Then your grub.cfg should be like this

===================== grub.cfg ============================================
Set timeout 5

menuentry "core-image-sato-NFS" {
    linux image/bzImage root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=192.168.1.1:/srv/rootfs,hard,tcp,intr ip=dhcp
    initrd image/initrd
}
